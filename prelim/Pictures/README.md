# Julia Favaro's Project - Fundamental Interactions Laboratory 2024-2025

## Preliminary lab experience

### Folder structure
-_Prel_ folder: preliminary lab experience on cosmic ray detection through Scintillators and PMT detectors.
-_Sciami_ folder: Lab experience on the characterization of extensive cosmic rays
-_Compton_ folder: 
-_Mulife_ folder: 

Each folder contains a README file that goes through all the code files and results obtained.

### Objectives of the experience
- Radiation-matter interaction: basic concepts, cross-sections, mean free path, relativistic kinematics.
- Introduction to radioactivity and radioprotection.
- Energy loss by ionization, range, ionization chambers, wire and drift chambers, solid-state detectors, and magnetic spectrometers.
- Scintillation and scintillation detectors. Photomultipliers, Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPM).
- Cerenkov effect and detectors exploiting this effect.
- Photon interactions, calorimetry. Basic concepts of silicon microstrip detectors. Basic concepts of trackers.
- Detection and acquisition chain, modular electronics.
- Basics of Root and C++.

#### Installation and usage
Some of the code was developed using the C++ language and the ROOT library. My partner Arianna and I obtained the datasets during our lab lectures. Documentation is embedded in the code. 

Some useful information on how to install ROOT:[ROOT on WSL](https://root-forum.cern.ch/t/complete-root-installation-instructions-for-wsl-ubuntu-18-04-on-windows-10/35148/3), [ROOT official installation page](https://root.cern/install/)
