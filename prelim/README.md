# Julia Favaro's Project - Fundamental Interactions Laboratory 2024-2025

##Preliminary lab experience: cosmic ray detection through Scintillators and PMT detectors.

### Folder organization:
- _Efficienza.py_: Python code that was used to create the graphs in the _Pictures_ folder,
- _notesROOT.txt_: a couple of notes taken during Paoloni's lecture on ROOT
- _ToyMC_: the first example of a ToyMontecarlo to replicate this experience. I
