### Repository structure
-_Prel_ folder: preliminary lab experience on cosmic ray detection through Scintillators and PMT detectors.
-_Sciami_ folder: Lab experience on the characterization of extensive cosmic rays
-_Compton_ folder: 
-_Mulife_ folder: 

Each folder contains a README file that goes through all the code files and results obtained.
