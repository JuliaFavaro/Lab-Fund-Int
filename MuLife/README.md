# Julia Favaro's Project - Fundamental Interactions Laboratory 2024-2025

## Muon decay lab experience


### Folder organization:

### Objectives of the experience
1. Verify the existence of possible temporal correlations between the arrivals of cosmic rays at successive times.
2. Verify the existence of correlated arrivals of cosmic rays in more than one telescope simultaneously (extended air showers). Characterize their frequency and any other information useful to investigate their physical origin.
3. Measure the flux of cosmic rays, both localized or extended, over long periods (days) and verify the existence of possible variations, daily or aperiodic, in the flux.

#### Installation and usage
Most of the code was developed using the C++ language and the ROOT library. My partner Arianna and I obtained the datasets during our lab lectures. This is available on a private Google Drive because of GitHub space limitation. Documentation is embedded in the code. 

Some useful information on how to install ROOT:[ROOT on WSL](https://root-forum.cern.ch/t/complete-root-installation-instructions-for-wsl-ubuntu-18-04-on-windows-10/35148/3), [ROOT official installation page](https://root.cern/install/)

The only Python file was originally developed as Jupyter Notebook on Anaconda.

Disclaimer: I'm bilingual and in many cases you will find comments in both languages, as this was written on the spot. This way of thinking helped me develop my project faster.
