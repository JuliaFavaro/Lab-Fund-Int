# Julia Favaro's Project - Fundamental Interactions Laboratory 2024-2025

## Compton Scattering lab experience

### Folder organization:

### Objectives of the experience
1. Observe the Compton scattering by measuring the energy of the outgoing photon at different angle of deflection and verify the theoretical prediction.
2. Report the rate as a function of the scattering angle.
3. Measure the mass of the electron.

#### Installation and usage
Most of the code was developed using the C++ language and the ROOT library. My partner Arianna and I obtained the datasets during our lab lectures. This is available on a private Google Drive because of GitHub space limitation. Documentation is embedded in the code. 

Some useful information on how to install ROOT:[ROOT on WSL](https://root-forum.cern.ch/t/complete-root-installation-instructions-for-wsl-ubuntu-18-04-on-windows-10/35148/3), [ROOT official installation page](https://root.cern/install/)

Disclaimer: I'm bilingual and in many cases you will find comments in both languages, as this was written on the spot. This way of thinking helped me develop my project faster.
